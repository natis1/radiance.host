<br>
The Radiance and the light she brings upon the world is the core and focus of our beliefs. The world can often seem like a dark place, and it's easy to lose sight of the truth by seeking out false gods and meaningless glory. But to remember her brilliance is to retain hope and happiness. Our goal is to bring this light to all beasts and bugs and to show them its beauty. We believe that to praise her light is to bask in it. To help others is to share it. To better ourselves is to become closer to it. We are peaceful beings who show the world the forgiveness the Radiance showed us. In doing this we wish to achieve a unity between all beings, connected through the happiness and wholesomeness she provides.
